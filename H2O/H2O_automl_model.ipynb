    "**Required Data Parameters**\n",
    "\n",
    "y: This argument is the name (or index) of the response column.  \n",
    "\n",
    "training_frame: Specifies the training set.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The user gives the name of the depenent variable and training file name.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Required Stopping Parameters**  \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the following stopping strategies (time or number-of-model based) must be specified. When both options are set, then the AutoML run will stop as soon as it hits one of either of these limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "max_runtime_secs: This argument controls how long the AutoML run will execute for. This defaults to 3600 seconds (1 hour).  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "max_models: Specify the maximum number of models to build in an AutoML run, excluding the Stacked Ensemble models. Defaults to NULL/None.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Optional Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "**Optional Data Parameters**  \n",
    "\n",
    "x: A list/vector of predictor column names or indexes. This argument only needs to be specified if the user wants to exclude columns from the set of predictors. If all columns (other than the response) should be used in prediction, then this does not need to be set.  \n",
    "\n",
    "validation_frame: This argument is used to specify the validation frame used for early stopping of individual models and early stopping of the grid searches (unless max_models or max_runtime_secs overrides metric-based early stopping).  \n",
    "\n",
    "leaderboard_frame: This argument allows the user to specify a particular data frame use to score & rank models on the leaderboard. This frame will not be used for anything besides leaderboard scoring. If a leaderboard frame is not specified by the user, then the leaderboard will use cross-validation metrics instead (or if cross-validation is turned off by setting nfolds = 0, then a leaderboard frame will be generated automatically from the validation frame (if provided) or the training frame).  \n",
    "\n",
    "fold_column: Specifies a column with cross-validation fold index assignment per observation. This is used to override the default, randomized, 5-fold cross-validation scheme for individual models in the AutoML run.  \n",
    "\n",
    "weights_column: Specifies a column with observation weights. Giving some observation a weight of zero is equivalent to excluding it from the dataset; giving an observation a relative weight of 2 is equivalent to repeating that row twice. Negative weights are not allowed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "ignored_columns: (Optional, Python only) Specify the column or columns (as a list/vector) to be excluded from the model. This is the converse of the x argument.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Optional Miscellaneous Parameters**  \n",
    "\n",
    "nfolds: Number of folds for k-fold cross-validation of the models in the AutoML run. Defaults to 5. Use 0 to disable cross-validation; this will also disable Stacked Ensembles (thus decreasing the overall best model performance).\n",
    "\n",
    "balance_classes: Specify whether to oversample the minority classes to balance the class distribution. This option is not enabled by default and can increase the data frame size. This option is only applicable for classification. Majority classes can be undersampled to satisfy the max_after_balance_size parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "class_sampling_factors: Specify the per-class (in lexicographical order) over/under-sampling ratios. By default, these ratios are automatically computed during training to obtain the class balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "max_after_balance_size: Specify the maximum relative size of the training data after balancing class counts (balance_classes must be enabled). Defaults to 5.0. (The value can be less than 1.0).\n",
    "\n",
    "stopping_metric: Specifies the metric to use for early stopping of the grid searches and individual models. Defaults to \"AUTO\". The available options are:\n",
    "\n",
    "AUTO: This defaults to logloss for classification, deviance for regression\n",
    "deviance (mean residual deviance)\n",
    "logloss\n",
    "MSE\n",
    "RMSE\n",
    "MAE\n",

    "lift_top_group\n",
    "misclassification\n",
    "mean_per_class_error  \n",
    "\n",
    "stopping_tolerance: This option specifies the relative tolerance for the metric-based stopping criterion to stop a grid search and the training of individual models within the AutoML run. This value defaults to 0.001 if the dataset is at least 1 million rows; otherwise it defaults to a bigger value determined by the size of the dataset and the non-NA-rate. In that case, the value is computed as 1/sqrt(nrows * non-NA-rate).\n",
    "\n",
    "stopping_rounds: This argument is used to stop model training when the stopping metric (e.g. AUC) doesn’t improve for this specified number of training rounds, based on a simple moving average. In the context of AutoML, this controls early stopping both within the random grid searches as well as the individual models. Defaults to 3 and must be an non-negative integer. To disable early stopping altogether, set this to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "sort_metric: Specifies the metric used to sort the Leaderboard by at the end of an AutoML run. Available options include:\n",
    "\n",
    "AUTO: This defaults to AUC for binary classification, mean_per_class_error for multinomial classification, and deviance for regression.\n",
    "deviance (mean residual deviance)\n",
    "logloss\n",
    "MSE\n",
    "RMSE\n",
    "MAE\n",
    "RMSLE\n",
    "AUC\n",
    "mean_per_class_error  \n",
    "\n",
    "seed: Integer. Set a seed for reproducibility. AutoML can only guarantee reproducibility if max_models is used because max_runtime_secs is resource limited, meaning that if the available compute resources are not the same between runs, AutoML may be able to train more models on one run vs another. Defaults to NULL/None.\n",
    "\n",
    "project_name: Character string to identify an AutoML project. Defaults to NULL/None, which means a project name will be auto-generated based on the training frame ID. More models can be trained and added to an existing AutoML project by specifying the same project name in muliple calls to the AutoML function (as long as the same training frame is used in subsequent runs).\n",
    "\n",
    "exclude_algos: List/vector of character strings naming the algorithms to skip during the model-building phase. An example use is exclude_algos = [\"GLM\", \"DeepLearning\", \"DRF\"] in Python or exclude_algos = c(\"GLM\", \"DeepLearning\", \"DRF\") in R. Defaults to None/NULL, which means that all appropriate H2O algorithms will be used, if the search stopping criteria allow. The algorithm names are:\n",

    "GLM\n",
    "DeepLearning\n",
    "GBM\n",
    "DRF (This includes both the Random Forest and Extremely Randomized Trees (XRT) models. Refer to the Extremely Randomized Trees section in the DRF chapter and the histogram_type parameter description for more information.)\n",
    "StackedEnsemble\n",
    "keep_cross_validation_predictions: Specify whether to keep the predictions of the cross-validation predictions. If set to FALSE, then running the same AutoML object for repeated runs will cause an exception because CV predictions are are required to build additional Stacked Ensemble models in AutoML. This option defaults to TRUE.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "keep_cross_validation_models: Specify whether to keep the cross-validated models. Deleting cross-validation models will save memory in the H2O cluster. This option defaults to TRUE.\n",

    "\n",
    "Cross-validation rather than taking a test training split reduces the variance of the estimates of goodness of fit statistics.  In rare cases one should take a test training split but this should be left to the expert users.\n",
    "\n",
    "This also means the pro user can just upload the data and not worry about taking a test training split.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We can pass the original, full dataset, `df` (without passing a `leaderboard_frame`).  This is a more efficient use of our data since we can use 100% of the data for training, rather than 80% or so.  This time our leaderboard will use cross-validated metrics. It also gives better estimates of goodness of fit statistics.\n",
