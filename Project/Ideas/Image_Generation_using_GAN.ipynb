    "\n",
    "We were first introduced to the idea of Neural Networks in Advanced Data Science class in Fall'17. Being new to the Data Science field we were fascinated by the thing that \"A machine could perform the tasks which were possible only by the humans before machine learning came into existence.\" Among all the tasks a machine could do by learning itself, Image Generation intrigued us the most. As this is our first time with the Image Generation the simplest thing and most thoughtful thing is to apply Generative Adversarial Networks to generate images. The main aim of this experiment is to understand, execute and improve the existing GAN to generate Hand Written digits using MNIST dataset."

    "\n",
    "Neural networks are computing systems somewhat inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. Such systems \"learn\" tasks by considering examples, generally without task-specific programming. For instance, in image recognition, they might learn to identify images that contain humans by analyzing example images that have been manually labeled as \"human\" or \"not a human\" and using the results to identify human in other images. They do this without any a priori knowledge about humans. For example, the networks aren't aware of legs, hands, and human-like faces that we possess. Instead, they evolve their own set of relevant characteristics from the learning material that they process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks use a cascade of multiple layers of nonlinear processing unit for feature extraction and transformation. Each successive layer uses the output from the previous layer as input. It is a type of unsupervised learning like pattern analysis. A deep neural network is an artificial neural network with multiple hidden layers between the input and output layers. They can model complex non-linear relationships. The extra layers enable composition of features from lower layers, potentially modeling complex data with fewer units than a similarly performing shallow network. These are typically feedforward networks in which data flows from the input layer to the output layer without looping back.\n",

    "### Introduction to GAN - Generative Adversarial Network\n",
    "Generative adversarial network (GAN) was introduced by Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues in 2014. GANs are a class of artificial intelligence algorithms used in unsupervised machine learning, implemented by a system of two neural networks. These two networks play against each other while co-training through the plain old backpropagation.\n",
    "\n",
    "GANs' potential is huge, because they can learn to mimic any kind of data distribution. That is, GANs can be taught to create worlds strangely similar to our own in various domains like images, music and speech. They are machine robot artists in a way, and their output is seriously impressive. Existing GANs have been mainly used for image generation tasks, with which they have showed impressive results and produced sharp and realistic images. Because of the flexible nature of the model definition and high-quality results, GANs have been applied to many real-world applications, including super-resolution, colorization, face generation, image completion, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working: Explain me like I am five!\n",
    "\n",
    "The working of a GAN lies within its name! Yes, its name! The word 'adversarial' is defined as characterized by conflict or opposition. The two networks that we mentioned earlier, contest with each other in a zero-sum game framework. Zero-sum game is a mathematical representation of a situation in which each network's gain or loss of utility is exactly balanced by the losses or gains of the utility of the other network. If the total gains of the networks are added up and the total losses are subtracted, they will sum to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the below illustration.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"GAN Basic.jpeg\",width=800,height=800>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, R is some real data set which is supplied to the model, G is the forger(generator) which is trying to generate fake images that looks just like the real-life image using the I which is random noise input, while D is Detective (discriminator) which is getting the generated images from the forger and real-life data set. Here, detective evaluates the fakes images and labels the difference. The fake labelled images are sent back to the forger via backpropagation. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, to sum up, G is trying to match real paintings with their output, while D is trying to tell the difference, except that in this case, the forger G never get to see the original data; just the judgments of D. Hence, over a period of time, both D and G will get better until G has become a master forger creating real-like images and D was unable to differentiate between the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another brief explanation from original GAN research paper:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The generative model can be thought of as analogous to a team of counterfeiters, trying to produce fake currency and use it without detection, while the discriminative model is analogous to the police, trying to detect the counterfeit currency. Competition in this game drives both teams to improve their methods until the counterfeits are indistinguishable from the genuine articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "To read a more about it, __[here](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661v1.pdf)__ is the link for the original paper introducing GAN.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important roadblock while training a GAN is stability. If you start to train a GAN, and the discriminator part is much powerful that its generator counterpart, the generator would fail to train effectively. This will in turn affect training of your GAN. On the other hand, if the discriminator is too lenient; it would let literally any image be generated. And this will mean that your GAN is useless.\n",

    "\n",
    "### How GANs work\n",
    "One neural network, called the *generator*, generates new data instances, while the other, the *discriminator*, evaluates them for authenticity; i.e. the discriminator decides whether each instance of data it reviews belongs to the actual training dataset or not.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Here are the steps a GAN takes:\n",
    " - The generator takes in random numbers and returns an image\n",
    " - This generated image is fed into the discriminator alongside a stream of images taken from the actual dataset\n",
    " - The discriminator takes in both real and fake images and returns probabilities, a number between 0 and 1, with 1 representing a prediction of authenticity and 0 representing fake\n",

    "### Why we use Activation functions with Neural Networks?\n",
    "\n",
    "It is used to determine the output of neural network like yes or no. It maps the resulting values in between 0 to 1 or -1 to 1 etc. (depending upon the function).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Acivation Functions used in GAN\n",
    "\n",
    " __1. Sigmoid or Logistic Activation Function__\n",
    "The Sigmoid Function curve looks like a S-shape.\n",
    "<img src=\"Sigmoid Activation Function.png\",width=600,height=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "The main reason why we use sigmoid function is because it exists between (0 to 1). Therefore, it is especially used for models where we have to __predict the probability__ as an output. Since probability of anything exists only between the range of __0 and 1__, sigmoid is the right choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Discriminator in GAN predicts the authenticity of the generated image and gives output as 0 or 1. Hence for Discriminator we are using Sigmoid as an Activation function.**\n",
    "\n",
    " __2. Tanh or hyperbolic tangent Activation Function__\n",
    "\n",
    "tanh is also like logistic sigmoid but better. The range of the tanh function is from (-1 to 1). tanh is also sigmoidal (s - shaped).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Tanh VS Sigmoid Activation Function.png\",width=600,height=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage is that the negative inputs will be mapped strongly negative and the zero inputs will be mapped near zero in the tanh graph. The tanh function is mainly used classification between two classes.\n",
    "\n",
    " __3. Leaky ReLU__\n",
    "\n",
    "The issue with ReLU is that all the negative values become zero immediately which decreases the ability of the model to fit or train from the data properly. That means any negative input given to the ReLU activation function turns the value into zero immediately in the graph, which in turns affects the resulting graph by not mapping the negative values appropriately.\n",
    "It is an attempt to solve the dying ReLU problem\n",
    "<img src=\"ReLU VS LeakyReLU Activation Function.png\",width=600,height=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "The leak helps to increase the range of the ReLU function.Usually, the value of a is 0.01 or so.\n",

    "\n",
    "The Deep Convolution Generative Adverserial Network (DCGAN) is an architecture for learning to generate new content just like GAN, also, it consists of a generator and discriminator. The only difference here is that DCGAN uses convolutional layers in both the networks, generator and discriminator.\n",

Next is a transposed convolution where we would halve the depth and double the width and height of the previous layer. Again, we use batch normalization and leaky ReLU. For each of these layers, the general scheme is Convolution > Batch Normalization > Leaky ReLU.\n",
    "\n",
    "Discriminator is basically just a convolutional classifier. Use batch normalization on each layer except the first convolutional and output layers. Again, each layer looks something like Convolution > Batch Normalization > Leaky ReLU. So, it takes real or fake MNIST digits and applies a series of convolutions. Then we use a sigmoid to make sure our output can be interpreted as the probability the input image is a real MNIST character.\n",

    "From the above outputs, we can see that DCGAN did a tremendous work in image generation as compared to simple GAN. The images generated by DCGAN are much clearer, have less noise around the digits and the digits are easily recognizable. These images have a better resolution as compared to GAN and this was only possible because of the convolution-deconvolution layers present in the DCGAN. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, we can see that the image generated by GAN is at 29600th epoch whereas the DCGAN generated image is just at 54th! DCGAN architecture is pretty complex when compared to vanilla GANs'. And because of this, it takes a huge processing power to generate the outputs. Its takes a high-end Graphics Processing Unit(GPU) if we want the network to perform fast. So, DCGAN generates better images at the expense of time factor. This is where GAN comes handy. If we don't have enough resources, we can use GAN and try to tweak its parameters over and over till we get acceptable results. But overall, if we want quality, DCGAN will be the winner everytime."

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "We started to work on this topic by referring different research papers and technical articles on GAN and DCGAN, and we learnt that the DCGAN generates images with better quality as compared to the vanilla GAN. To test this, we began to learn and understand the detailed architecture and working of GAN and DCGAN, ultimately implementing it on the MNIST dataset. Furthermore, we also studied and compared the results of both the networks using graphs and output images. Since the evaluation of the quality of generated images is subjective, we will let ourselves be human discriminators and make statements on whether the generated images look recognizable and elegant to us. Thus by comparing results i.e. images generated by both the networks, we observed that the images generated by the DCGAN have overall better quality than generated by GAN, thus, confirming our learning."
